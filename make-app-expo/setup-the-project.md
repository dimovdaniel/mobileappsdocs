# Setup the project

Download the app source code from CodeCanyon and extract it.\
Open the source code in your favorite text/code editor. We suggest [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

There you will find the file **config.js**

Replace the values with your real values, like the ULR link, desired currency.&#x20;

### The things you need to change

{% hint style="success" %}
**exports.domain** - with your real domain\
\
example.

"exports.domain = "[https://restotiger.com](https://restotiger.com/api/v2)";
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**exports.LOGO=**"https://site.com/image.png"; -- Link to your logo ( can be the one on the login screen )


{% endhint %}
