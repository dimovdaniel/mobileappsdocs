# AppCenter.ms

{% hint style="success" %}
We highly recommend AppCenter.ms  - it can make the app-making process really easy, you don't need to install node, pod files, change app icons, or app name locally. 
{% endhint %}

Up till now, the previous steps were for you to configure your app. 

At this step, you can decide if you want to publish the app from your computer or use [AppCenter.ms](https://appcenter.ms/) to do that.

The video below is how you should do it in AppCenter.

{% hint style="danger" %}
You need to set two environment variables in AppCenter.ms \( not recorded in the video \)
{% endhint %}

```text
APP_NAME="My Super Food"
APP_ID="com.mycomapany.appname"
```
