# Rename the app

The renaming process is a bit tricky. That is why we made a video, to correctly explain to you how to do it. Please look at the video in details, every step is mandatory, and if you miss some, you can face errors.

This step is commonly skipped by our clients since it is a bit boring and they want to directly start the app. But note that if you skip this step at first, you will need to do the job of installing twice, and you may get errors. That is why this step is required at this stage.
